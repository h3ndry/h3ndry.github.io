      <description>If you are like me, the reason you chose Udemy as a leaning platform is because of their insane discount on courses, but that serve nothing if you are from a country where data bundles cost too much. You end up pay more to access the course than the actual cost of the course. I will not even begin to mention the issue of slow network speed. One solution from this is to download the videos from your course and watch them offline, and I am going to show you just that.</description>
