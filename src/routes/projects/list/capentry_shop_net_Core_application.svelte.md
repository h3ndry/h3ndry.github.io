*This project is one of my favorites application I have developed and
I am proud of it*


###

Carpetry Shop is my favourite .Net applicatin  I have build, Is a
complete fullstack application with databbase, Authetication and
elegant design. I have used Linode to host the applicaton on a
Ubuntu Server


### Entity Framework

To intergrate with the databse I use EF core which is a recomended by
Microsoft when using .Net Core. Entity framwrok core is a moredern object-databbase
mapper for .NET, It Support LINQ queries, Changes, tracking, update and schema
migration

The nice thing with EF Core is that it works with many database on the
project I am using it works with postgress database

### Design and Styles

The design of the web application is styled using  the Semantic UI. I have
enjoy working with UI libray. It makes buildings beautiful website easy

What I enjoy the most with this UI libray is the way easy it is to overwrite
the style without overhead


### Deploy and Hosting

I love Linuxx, So it is not a suprice that I hosted this web application on a linux
Sever application on. On a Linux sever The challenging part was to configure apache
server to work together. I do not have problem with azure just that is so expensive
for a Linode Sever I am paying R90 for this sever per month which is much less
that what I would have pay if I am with Azure

### Deploy and Hosting
I respect Microsto for making .Net open sourche. I will continues usin the
.Net core for building more personla web application
