I built MaGibile's website with beautiy and elegance in mind. I wanted to make the
artist haapy when they see their site. The Design is expired by one of the desiner at
uplabs, I forget his user details, I will update this ehwn I remember. The artist 
metion to me that red is his favorite color, so I deliverd.


### Features

- On the homepage of the webiste, you can play top song of the artist. This is archived by
calling the Spotify Rest API. In addition to that, I have nice visual to show progress
of the current playing song
- Fully responsive, The webiste adjust to small screen size such as mobile devices, which come in 
handy since the boomer generation spend to much time on their phone.
- The website also have a functional working contact form that let you contact the artist for 
booking information

### Tech Stack

The Technology I used to develop this beautifuj website is SvelteKit (The NextJs of Svelte)
I like this framework, because of how they aproch the frontend development, Compiling everything
to javascript is much more faster that the idear of virtual dom. The framwork fell fast on my old
thinkpad laptop unlike react that freeze often. Hot reaload is quick, thanks to vite

I don't mind CSS, but whenever I can, I use SCSS or SASS. It is what I used for this project
the, the diffrence is minor now since CSS support varialble now but the Killer feacture for
SCSS if having nested style. I think it is also easy to share style between project with 
SCSS 

### Hosting

Simple and straight forward. I use netlify.
