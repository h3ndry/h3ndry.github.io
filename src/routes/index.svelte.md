Softwares has become integrated into all parts of our lives, and I am obsessed
with user experience and minimalistic software. I like the [UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) that states each
program should do one thing and do it well. I try to keep that in mind when I develop software.

I spent a large part of my day writing code, reading
documentation, and configuring my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/h3ndry/dotfiles). I am very proud to be part of
the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) open source community. It has enabled me to
learn\nmore about the great features that Neovim provides to developers, and in
doing so, it has made me a better developer. Right now, I am all about Linux,
Front-End Development, and cloud computing. Like other Linux enthusiasts, I
often spent hours configuring arch Linux, writing scripts to automate some of
the tasks, and for the part I enjoy the most, configuring Neovim to improve my
development flow. When I started using Neovim, I swear it was like I discovered
a secret formula. Finally, I can focus more on the code and functionality than
fighting with the IDE to do a simple thing.

## Outside
Outside of work, I enjoy watching TedTalk, science fiction movies,
and cartoons. I am a proud South African! I like working with brilliant,
driven, creative, and destructive people who want to do more than talk about
change."
