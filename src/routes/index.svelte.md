Hello, world! I am a Software Engineer who studied Computer System Engineering
at the [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/). My
qualification includes hardware and software, although I know logic gates,
resistors, transistors, and the rest of the low-level staff. My passion lies
more in software development. I am skilled in system design, Object-Oriented
Programming, and database design principles.

During my final year at university, I discovered the world of open-source. I
couldn't believe that the university did not teach us about this anyway my
favorite open source project is [ LibreOffice ](https://www.libreoffice.org/),
[ Inkscape ](https://inkscape.org/), [ Gimp ](https://www.gimp.org/), and [
Neovim ](https://neovim.io/). One of my goals is to contribute my skill to most
of those projects. I remember when I started using Linux. I felt a sense of
accomplishment and freedom to use the software you can configure however you
want.

Looking back, using open-source software has taught me a lot about computers,
more specifically the [ Suckless ](https://suckless.org/) organization. A window Manager is one of the
software you interact with every time you use your computers, to be able to
customize it to however you want, it makes your computer feel really yours. I
spent a lot of my time reading and editing the [ DWM ](https://dwm.suckless.org/) source code. It was
worthwhile. I am also motivated to build Linux from scratch just for learning
purposes.

<!-- Software has become integrated into all parts of our lives, and I am obsessed -->
<!-- with user experience and minimalistic software. I like the [UNIX -->
<!-- philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) that states each -->
<!-- program should do one thing and do it well. I try to keep that in mind when I develop software.   -->
<!-- I spent a large part of my day writing code, reading -->
<!-- documentation, and configuring my -->
<!-- [dotfiles](https://github.com/h3ndry/dotfiles). I am very proud to be part of -->
<!-- the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) open source community. It has enabled me to -->
<!-- learn\nmore about the great features that Neovim provides to developers, and in -->
<!-- doing so, it has made me a better developer. Right now, I am all about Linux, -->
<!-- Front-End Development, and cloud computing. Like other Linux enthusiasts, I -->
<!-- often spent hours configuring arch Linux, writing scripts to automate some of -->
<!-- the tasks, and for the part I enjoy the most, configuring Neovim to improve my -->
<!-- development flow. When I started using Neovim, I swear it was like I discovered -->
<!-- a secret formula. Finally, I can focus more on the code and functionality than -->
<!-- fighting with the IDE to do a simple thing. -->

## Outside Work

Outside work, I enjoy watching TedTalk, science fiction movies, and cartoons. I
am a proud South African! I like hanging out with brilliant, driven, creative,
and destructive people who want to do more than talk about change.
