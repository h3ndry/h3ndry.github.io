Hello world! I am a software Engineer who studied Computer System Engineering at
the Tshwane University of Technology. My qualification include both hardware and
software, Although I have knowledge about logic gate, resisters, transistors and
the rest of the low level staff my passion lies more in to software development.
I am skilled in system design, Object Oriented Programming and database design 
principles.

During my final year at University I have discovered the world of open source,
I couldn't believe that university did not teach us about this, anyway my 
favorite open souece project is Libre Office, Inkscape, Gimp and Neovim. One 
of my goal is to contribute my skill to most of those project. I remember 
when I started using Linux, I felt a sense of accomplishment and freedom to 
use a software that you can configure to how ever you want.

Looking back, using open source software has though me a lot about computers
and software, more specific the suckless organisation. A window Manager is one 
og the programme you interact with every time you use your computers and to be 
able to customize it to how ever you want it make your computer feel really 
yours. I lot of my time reading and editing the DWM source code. Its was a
time worth while. I am also motivate to build Linux from stretch now, just
for learning purposes.

<!-- Software has become integrated into all parts of our lives, and I am obsessed -->
<!-- with user experience and minimalistic software. I like the [UNIX -->
<!-- philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) that states each -->
<!-- program should do one thing and do it well. I try to keep that in mind when I develop software.   -->
<!-- I spent a large part of my day writing code, reading -->
<!-- documentation, and configuring my -->
<!-- [dotfiles](https://github.com/h3ndry/dotfiles). I am very proud to be part of -->
<!-- the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) open source community. It has enabled me to -->
<!-- learn\nmore about the great features that Neovim provides to developers, and in -->
<!-- doing so, it has made me a better developer. Right now, I am all about Linux, -->
<!-- Front-End Development, and cloud computing. Like other Linux enthusiasts, I -->
<!-- often spent hours configuring arch Linux, writing scripts to automate some of -->
<!-- the tasks, and for the part I enjoy the most, configuring Neovim to improve my -->
<!-- development flow. When I started using Neovim, I swear it was like I discovered -->
<!-- a secret formula. Finally, I can focus more on the code and functionality than -->
<!-- fighting with the IDE to do a simple thing. -->

## Outside
Outside of work, I enjoy watching TedTalk, science fiction movies,
and cartoons. I am a proud South African! I like working with brilliant,
driven, creative, and destructive people who want to do more than talk about
change."
