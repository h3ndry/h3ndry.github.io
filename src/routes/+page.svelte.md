Hello, world! I am a Software Engineer who studied Computer System Engineering
at the [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/). My qualification includes hardware and
software, although I know logic gates, resistors, transistors, and the rest of
the low-level staff. My passion lies more in software development. I am skilled
in system design, Object-Oriented Programming, and database design principles.

During my final year at university, I discovered the world of open-source. I
couldnâ€™t believe that the university did not teach us about open source. My
favourite open-source project is [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/),
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), and
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/). One
of my goals is to contribute my skill to most of those projects. I remember
when I started using Linux. I felt a sense of accomplishment and freedom to use
an operating system that you can customise to whatever you like.

Open-source software has taught me much about computers, specifically the
[Suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org/) organisation. A window Manager is one of the software you interact
with every time you use your computers. Customising it however you want makes
your computer feel yours. I spent a lot of time reading and editing the [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/dwm)
source code. It was worthwhile. I am also motivated to build Linux from scratch
just for learning purposes.


## Outside Work

Outside Work Outside work, I enjoy watching
TedTalk, science fiction movies, and cartoons. I am a proud South African! I
like hanging out with brilliant, driven, creative, and destructive people who
want to do more than talk about change.
